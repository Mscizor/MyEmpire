# MyEmpire

Project done for CCPROG3 (Object-oriented Programming) done in the A.Y. 2018-2019 Term 3. 
A board game based on the game Monopoly. Learned fundamental object-oriented programming.

# Insights

It was pretty tough for this term seeing as it included creating an actual user interface that wasn't the command line.
Unfortunately, we weren't able to completely finish the project. I'm taking this as an experience to become more
responsible about the time used and wasted.

# Learnings

+ Reading through Java documentation
+ Learning how to manage time and effort between teammates
+ Became more attentive to details and what the end-user (the professor) needs
